# Re-TUI TODO

This is a working backlog for issues and user requests after the timer/pomodoro/widget-page branch was merged into `master`.

Phone UAT checklist: `docs/TESTBOOK.md`.

## Product Direction - Distraction-Free Workstation Surface

Re:T-UI is a distraction-free Android workstation surface for people who prefer commands, local control, and composable workflows over visual launcher clutter.

It should not chase casual launcher expectations. It should reward users who are willing to type `help`, read docs, configure aliases, and build their own phone workflow.

### Rollout Phase 1 - Help, Identity, And First Wow

- [x] Merge onboarding into `help`.
- [x] Keep first-run lightweight. No guided tour, no casual-user wizard.
- [x] No-arg `help` should suggest:
  - launch an app
  - create an alias
  - hide an app
  - apply a wallpaper-derived theme
  - save the theme as a preset
  - inspect/show modules
- [x] Link help output and wiki docs to the relevant reference pages.
- [x] Explore first-install `wallpaper -auto` as an immediate wow moment.
  - Implemented as a blank-input suggestion while the user has no saved presets.
  - Do not auto-run it; wallpaper-derived theming remains user-initiated.
- [x] Defer starter presets. Wallpaper auto is the preferred first personalization path.

### Rollout Phase 2 - Search And Suggestions 2.0

- [x] Audit current fuzzy search across apps, commands, aliases, contacts, and settings.
- [x] Define what Search 2.0 adds beyond current behavior before implementing new UI.
- [x] Favor a result-first flow:
  - typed intent surfaces relevant objects in suggestions
  - selecting an object can reveal contextual actions
- [x] Contact example:
  - typing a name surfaces the person
  - selecting the contact exposes call, contact details, and edit actions
- [x] App example:
  - selecting or long-selecting an app can expose open, hide, app info, group, or uninstall
  - decision: keep root app suggestions launch-first
  - app management stays under explicit `apps` commands: `apps -l`, `apps -hide`, `apps -st`, `apps -ps`, and group commands
  - revisit long-press app actions later only if direct launch remains untouched
- [x] Do not prioritize command history; aliases and toolbar up-arrow already cover frequent/recent command needs.

### Rollout Phase 3 - Re:T-UI Native Modules

- [x] Build on the current module system rather than replacing it.
- [x] Keep built-in modules as Re:T-UI-owned terminal surfaces.
- [x] Keep script-backed modules as the extensibility model.
- [x] Design a module callback contract that can update:
  - module body text
  - module title/status
  - suggestion entries
  - optional action payloads
- [x] When a module is active, allow its suggestions to temporarily own the suggestion row.
  - First slice implemented for command-backed built-in modules.
  - Suggestions appear only when input is empty.
  - Normal typing still wins.
- [x] For Termux-backed modules, define how suggestion clicks are sent back to the script or callback bridge.
  - First implementation supports script-provided `command` suggestions.
  - `termux-run` and `callback` modes remain parsed contract values, but are not executable suggestion modes yet.
- [x] Avoid arbitrary Java/Kotlin plugin loading. Scripts plus controlled Re:T-UI primitives are the boundary.
- Draft contract:
  - body: text rendered inside the active module
  - title: short module label/status line
  - suggest: one or more suggestion chips owned by the active module
  - action: command/script payload tied to a suggestion
  - mode: how action is dispatched, such as `command`, `termux-run`, or `callback`
- First design target:
  - [x] active module can temporarily replace normal suggestions
  - [x] inactive modules do not hijack suggestions
  - [x] suggestion clicks are explicit and inspectable for command-mode built-ins
  - no arbitrary code is loaded into Re:T-UI
- Next implementation slice:
  - [x] parse script module metadata lines from Termux stdout
  - [x] cache script-provided suggestions with the module body
  - [x] support `command` mode first
  - design `termux-run` dispatch before enabling it

### Rollout Phase 4 - Deliberate App Drawer

- Keep app groups deliberate through the existing group command flow.
- Do not make automatic grouping a headline feature.
- Polish the drawer around terminal identity:
  - terminal frame
  - alphabet navigation
  - user-created groups
  - hidden apps respected
  - wallpaper visible outside the drawer
- Revisit drawer ergonomics for one-handed use.
- [x] Move group tabs away from the top-left toward a bottom horizontal rail.
- Keep group creation/editing in `apps` commands; drawer tabs only switch views.

### Rollout Phase 5 - Workflow Aliases

- [x] Confirm aliases already support command chaining through `multiple_cmd_separator` (`;` by default).
- [x] Replace the proposed recipe system with workflow-alias documentation.
- Do not add `recipe -ls`, `recipe -preview`, `recipe -apply`, or `recipe -undo`; that would duplicate aliases.
- Treat aliases as the official inspectable workflow layer.
- Document chained alias examples for:
  - focus
  - dev
  - morning
  - privacy
  - commute
- Leave these alias polish ideas for later:
  - better `alias -ls` formatting
  - `alias -show <name>`
  - `alias -run <name>` only if direct alias execution becomes unclear
  - warnings if an alias chain contains destructive commands

### Rollout Phase 6 - Automation And Chaining

- Alias chaining audit complete: aliases can already expand into multi-command chains.
- [x] Audit existing automation surfaces before adding new primitives.
- Existing surfaces:
  - workflow aliases: manual multi-command chains through `;`
  - Termux: `termux -run` and script-backed modules
  - callbacks: token-gated `output`, `notify`, and `module_set`
  - webhooks: saved POST templates with argument substitution
  - shortcuts: Android app shortcut launch
  - notifications/reply: notification filters, terminal notification toggle, bound reply apps
  - clocks: timer, stopwatch, and pomodoro state broadcasts
- Do not add another basic chaining feature.
- Add new automation primitives only if they solve gaps aliases cannot express cleanly.
- Real gaps to discuss later:
  - conditions: run only if state matches
  - confirmations: ask before sensitive commands
  - scheduling: run command/alias at time or interval
  - failure handling: stop or continue when one command in a chain fails
  - external triggers: allow narrow trigger events without arbitrary external command execution
- Security boundary:
  - keep token-gated callbacks narrow
  - do not expose arbitrary external command execution through callbacks
  - prefer callbacks that update output/modules over callbacks that run commands

### Rollout Phase 7 - Focus Profiles

- Defer detailed design.
- Decide later whether focus profiles are workflow aliases, settings snapshots, module layouts, app visibility filters, or a mix.
- Avoid a complex profile manager unless it clearly reduces setup friction.
- Keep profiles inspectable and editable.

### Rollout Phase 8 - Trust, Distribution, And Community

- Privacy-first positioning:
  - local config
  - no ads
  - no tracking
  - clear permissions
- Keep Play Store stable and Firebase beta experimental.
- Maintain this roadmap in `docs/TODO.md`.
- Support community sharing for aliases, modules, workflow aliases, themes, and ASCII headers.
- Add migration docs for Nova-style power users, Niagara/minimal launcher users, Termux users, and original T-UI users.

## Completed In v325

- Brightness permission flow
  - Added `WRITE_SETTINGS` to the manifest.
  - Updated the brightness command to deep-link into Re-TUI's own "Modify system settings" permission screen.

- Package name / side-by-side install
  - Confirmed active app id is `com.dvil.tui_renewed`.
  - Namespaced the custom `RECEIVE_CMD` permission to `${applicationId}` to avoid collision with the original upstream launcher.

- Themer navigation stacking
  - The settings/Themer terminal surface now forces an opaque internal background.
  - The outside overlay can still let wallpaper bleed through without showing prior Themer screens under the current one.

- Widget / terminal polish
  - Added separate theme keys for music and notification widget border/text colors.
  - Added auto-color support for those new keys.
  - Widget border labels now paint an opaque surface mask so border lines do not show through transparent themes.
  - Music song line now uses `Title:` instead of repeating `Now Playing:`.
  - Toolbar app drawer icon background was aligned with the other toolbar buttons.

- Branch/release
  - Merged `codex/timer-stopwatch` into `master`.
  - Published Firebase build `325`.
  - Created `codex/termux-integration` from the merged `master`.

## Completed On `codex/termux-integration`

- Removed the abandoned native Android widget/dashboard experiment.
  - Dropped the second ViewPager dashboard page.
  - Removed the `dashboard`/`widgets` command surface.
  - Kept page 0 focused on Re-TUI-owned music and notification terminals.

- Tightened the music terminal controls.
  - Stabilized the `PREV`, `PLAY/PAUSE`, and `NEXT` row with weighted button widths.
  - Reduced oversized title/singer text while keeping controls readable.

- Normalized terminal border behavior for current widget surfaces.
  - `enable_dashed_border=false` now removes the terminal-style widget border.
  - `enable_dashed_border=true` with gap `0` remains the solid-border path.

- Started the layered home terminal cutover.
  - Output/input/suggestions now live in a bottom overlay tray instead of pushing the home module layer.
  - Added an `[ OUTPUT ^ ]` tray handle for expanding and collapsing output history.
  - Back now collapses expanded output before normal launcher back behavior.

- Started Termux setup guidance.
  - Added `termux -setup` to the command surface and suggestions.
  - The Termux console now prints the required `allow-external-apps=true` setup, script folder convention, script alias example, and permission reminder.
  - Added first-pass wiki docs for Termux setup, script aliases, and safe run flow.

## High Priority

- Remove Android widget/dashboard experiment (done on `codex/termux-integration`; pending merge)
  - Drop the native Android `AppWidgetHost` surface and the current `widgets` command path.
  - Keep the idea of user-extensible panels, but rebuild it as Re-TUI-owned modules.
  - Do not support KWGT/native Android widgets for now; they break visual consistency and add provider/OEM instability.

- Fix music widget control sizing (done on `codex/termux-integration`; pending wider device testing)
  - Restore readable `PREV`, `PLAY/PAUSE`, and `NEXT` text while keeping the compact widget height.
  - Make the control row stable across narrow devices and large user font settings.
  - Keep the visualizer as the background layer and avoid button squish when text scale changes.

- Normalize border behavior (partially done; continue applying to settings/app drawer/Termux/module surfaces as new surfaces change)
  - `enable_dashed_border=false` should mean no terminal-style border on all Re-TUI terminal surfaces.
  - `enable_dashed_border=true` with gap `0` should mean a solid terminal border.
  - `enable_dashed_border=true` with gap greater than `0` should mean dashed border.
  - Apply this consistently to music, notifications, input/output, settings, app drawer, Termux console, and future modules.

## Phase 1 - Layered Home Terminal

- Split the home screen into two conceptual layers:
  - Layer 1: status, ASCII art, module dock, active module, wallpaper.
  - Layer 2: output, input, suggestions, toolbar.
- Convert output/input/suggestions into a terminal tray overlay rather than a layout section that pushes other content.
- Add output expand/collapse behavior:
  - Collapsed: compact output history plus input and suggestions.
  - Expanded: scrollable output history for reviewing logs.
  - Back button collapses expanded output before normal back behavior.
- Keep input focus stable when expanding/collapsing output.
- Ensure expanded output intentionally blocks module interaction, while collapsed output leaves Layer 1 usable.

## Phase 2 - Re-TUI Native Modules

- Replace the native widget/dashboard idea with Re-TUI-owned modules.
- Add a slim module dock below the ASCII art.
  - Example dock items: `MUSIC`, `NOTIF`, `TIMER`, `CAL`.
  - Tapping one module closes the previous module and opens the selected one.
  - Active module item is highlighted.
- Add close control to module windows.
- Start with built-in modules:
  - Music visualizer/player module.
  - Notification terminal module.
  - Timer/stopwatch/pomodoro module.
  - Calendar module, monthly view first.
- Keep module command surface command-first:
  - `module -ls`
  - `module -show music`
  - `module -hide music`
  - `module -close`
  - `module -dock add server`
  - `module -dock remove music`
- Module visibility rules:
  - Hiding/removing from dock does not delete the module from the registry.
  - Deleting/removing from registry is a separate explicit command.

## Phase 3 - Script Modules

- Status: first implementation done; pending phone UAT.
- Add script-backed custom modules after built-in modules are stable.
- Start with a strict text-output contract:
  - Termux runs the script.
  - Re-TUI renders stdout inside a terminal module box.
  - No arbitrary Java/Kotlin/plugin code loading.
- Initial commands:
  - `module -add server termux:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/retui/server.sh`
  - `module -refresh server`
  - `module -show server`
  - `module -hide server`
  - `module -rm server`
- Dock commands are append/remove only:
  - `module -dock add server`
  - `module -dock remove music`
- Keep script files owned by Termux/user storage; Re-TUI should never delete the source script.
- Later enhancement: controlled Re-TUI markup primitives:
  - text color spans
  - progress bars
  - tables
  - action buttons
  - refresh interval

## Phase 4 - Termux Integration

- Keep the current `termux` console command and `-s` script alias scope.
- Add `termux -setup`.
  - First pass done: explain required Termux setting, script folder convention, script alias example, and Android permission prompt flow.
  - Helper docs done: `retui-helper.sh` with `retui_output` and `retui_module` examples.
- Callback authorization foundation is started.
  - `retui-token -status`
  - `retui-token -show`
  - `retui-token -rotate`
  - `retui-token -on`
  - `retui-token -off`
  - Callbacks remain disabled by default until a token is explicitly created/enabled.
- Callback receiver is token-gated and intentionally narrow.
  - Safe first actions: `output`, `notify`, `module_set`.
  - `module_set` now updates custom script modules.
  - Hold dangerous/general `command` execution for a later opt-in "danger mode"; do not add it without a design pass.
- Example helper API:
  - `retui output "Backup complete"`
  - `retui notify "Server down" "prod-api failed health check"`
  - `retui module set server "HTTP OK\nCPU 42%"`
  - `retui module refresh server`

## Phase 5 - Tasker Integration

- Reuse the same callback API built for Termux.
- Document Tasker "Send Intent" templates.
- Do not require Termux for Tasker integration.
- Useful Tasker-driven module updates:
  - Wi-Fi/VPN state
  - battery profile
  - location/home-away mode
  - Bluetooth device state
  - calendar/focus mode
  - smart-home shortcuts

## Phase 6 - Webhook Strengthening

- Revisit webhook storage and command UX.
- Add better inspection and test commands.
- Make webhook output/callback behavior consistent with modules.
- Consider module and Termux callback triggers for webhook dispatch.

## Deferred / Watchlist

- True cutout borders for floating tabs
  - Current widget/module tabs use an opaque surface mask to hide the parent border line.
  - Research found Material `TextInputLayout` has a similar outlined floating-label cutout behavior, but it is text-field-specific and not a good visual fit for Re-TUI.
  - Preferred future approach: build a small custom terminal border view/drawable that draws the border in segments and skips the tab rectangle.
  - Estimate: roughly 1 focused day for one reusable custom view/drawable, plus another pass to wire and test it across music, notifications, output tray, app drawer, settings, and Termux.
  - Keep the mask approach for now unless transparent tab backgrounds become a real user pain point.

- Native Android widget hosting
  - Deferred intentionally.
  - Reconsider only if there is strong demand and a stable constrained UX.

- Arbitrary Java/Kotlin user modules
  - Avoid for now due to security, crash, Play policy, and support risk.
  - Prefer script modules with controlled Re-TUI-rendered primitives.

- Per-app notification coloring
  - Deferred unless community demand is strong.
  - Current notification terminal should remain visually consistent with the theme.

## Integrations

- Termux integration
  - Current active branch: `codex/termux-integration`.
  - Current near-term work should focus on safe `termux -setup` polish and script-run UX only.
  - Callback auth and callback intents are intentionally paused until design discussion.
